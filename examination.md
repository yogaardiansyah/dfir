## 5. EXAMINATION METHODOLOGY

This section describes the technical process step-by-step.

*   **Precautionary Measures:**
    *   Exhibit `EXH-01` was placed in a Faraday Bag to prevent network connectivity.
    *   The examination was conducted in an isolated forensic laboratory.
    *   A hardware write-blocker was used during all acquisition processes to prevent writing any data to the original evidence.

*   **Tools and Equipment Used:**
    *   **Hardware:** `[e.g., Tableau Forensic Imager TX1, Forensic Workstation Spec X, Faraday Bag]`
    *   **Software:** `[e.g., Magnet AXIOM vX.X, Cellebrite UFED 4PC vX.X, Autopsy vX.X]`

*   **Data Acquisition Process:**
    1.  Exhibit `EXH-01` was connected to the forensic workstation via a write-blocker.
    2.  A physical acquisition of the internal memory of `EXH-01` was performed using `Cellebrite UFED 4PC`.
    3.  The acquisition resulted in an image file with the `.ufd` format.
    4.  Hash values were generated to validate data integrity:
        *   **MD5:** `[MD5 Hash Value of the image file]`
        *   **SHA256:** `[SHA256 Hash Value of the image file]`
    5.  The same process was repeated for the memory card `EXH-03`.

*   **Data Analysis Process:**
    1.  The acquired image file was loaded into the `Magnet AXIOM` software.
    2.  Data parsing and carving were performed to extract digital artifacts.
    3.  The analysis focused on conversation artifacts from the following applications: `WhatsApp`, `Telegram`, `Instagram Direct Message`, and `SMS`.
    4.  Searches were conducted using keywords relevant to the case, such as: `[e.g., "transfer", "account", "prize", victim's name, suspect's name]`.
    5.  File metadata (creation dates, modification dates, GPS location if available) was analyzed.
