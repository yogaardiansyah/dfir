## 5. Timeline of Events

Create a detailed timeline of relevant activities. Use a table format for clarity.

| Date & Time (UTC) | Activity Description | Evidence Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` | First suspicious activity detected. | `Firewall Log ID: X` |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` | Attacker gained initial access. | `Authentication Log Server Y` |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` | Privilege escalation occurred. | `Operating System Log Z` |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` | Data was exfiltrated to an external IP address. | `Network Logs/Netflow` |
| `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` | Incident response team initiated the investigation. | `Internal Notes` |

## 6. Evidence Collection and Analysis

### 6.1. Evidence Collected

Describe the digital evidence that was collected.

| Evidence ID | Evidence Type | Source | Hash (SHA256) | Acquisition Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EVD-001` | Memory Image | `Web-Server-01` | `[hash]` | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `EVD-002` | Disk Image | `User-A-Laptop` | `[hash]` | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `EVD-003` | Firewall Logs | `Palo Alto FW` | `N/A` | `YYYY-MM-DD` |

### 6.2. Analysis Methodology

Describe the methodology and tools used to analyze the evidence.

*   **Memory Analysis:** Used `Volatility` to analyze the memory image and search for malicious processes.
*   **Disk Analysis:** Used `Autopsy` or `EnCase` to examine file system artifacts, registry, and deleted files.
*   **Log Analysis:** Used `Splunk` or `ELK Stack` to correlate logs from various sources.
*   **Network Analysis:** Used `Wireshark` to analyze captured network traffic.

## 7. Investigation Findings

This is the most detailed section of the report. Present all technical findings in a structured manner.

### 7.1. Initial Access
*   Describe how the attacker first gained entry into the network (e.g., phishing, vulnerability exploitation, stolen credentials).

### 7.2. Execution
*   Describe how the attacker executed malicious code.

### 7.3. Persistence
*   Describe how the attacker maintained their access (e.g., scheduled task, new service).

### 7.4. Privilege Escalation
*   Describe how the attacker obtained higher access rights.

### 7.5. Lateral Movement
*   Describe how the attacker moved from one system to another within the network.

### 7.6. Impact
*   Describe the actions taken by the attacker that affected confidentiality, integrity, or availability (e.g., data theft, ransomware encryption).

### 7.7. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
*   Present the IOCs in a clear format.

| IOC Type | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `IP Address` | `123.123.123.123` | C2 Server IP Address |
| `File Hash` | `[sha256_hash]` | Malware Hash |
| `Domain` | `malicious-domain.com` | C2 Domain |
| `URL` | `http://malicious-domain.com/payload.exe` | Malware download URL |

## 8. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Steps

*   **Containment:** Describe the steps taken to isolate the infected systems and prevent further spread.
*   **Eradication:** Describe how threat components (e.g., malware, malicious user accounts) were removed from the environment.
*   **Recovery:** Describe the process of restoring systems to normal operation, such as restoring from backups or rebuilding systems.
